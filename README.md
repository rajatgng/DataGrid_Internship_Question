To run the program you can directly click the above link.

For taking the input:
1. First line should contain value of a.
2. Second line should contain value of b.
3. Third line should contain value of c.
4. Fourth line should contain value of d.

* In the Second example i.e. (a=1,b=3) ,(c=2,d=5) the value of c should be 1 as the next line(in the question) is saying that 
output: true , since is possible to reach (1,5) Hence I think that was the miss print there and value of c should be 1 but there given is 2.
